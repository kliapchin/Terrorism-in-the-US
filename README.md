Team Members: Kristina L., Nalorm T., Sarah B.

# Summary
For this project, my team and I set out to analyze the Global Terrorism Database, maintained by The University of Maryland, which contains data on over 180,000 global terrorist attacks from 1970-2017. 

The following definition of terrorism was used for this project:
"The threatened or actual use of illegal force and violence by a non-state actor to attain a political, economic, religious, or social goal through fear, coercion, or intimidation‚Äù (provided The Global Terrorism Database).

The goal of this project was to identify patterns and changes in terrorist activity in the US before and after the 9/11 attacks. We focused our analysis on the types of attacks, perpetrators, and victims. 

# Findings
* There has been an increase in two particular types of attacks in the 2000s: *armed assaults* and *facility / infrastructure attacks*.
* Armed assaults and facility attacks by White Extremists and Anti-muslim Nationalists are at an all-time high since the mid 1970s.
* Since 9/11, armed assaults and facility attacks have been primarily of religious nature
    * Assaults on religious individuals and facilities have increased by 588%.
* Since 9/11, there has also been an increase in the racial nature of these types of attacks:
    * Most attacks are conducted by White perpetrators.
    * Attacks on Arabic victims have seen the greatest increase, 1677%.
